        <p align="left"> Computer science has come a long way compared to what it was like in the past. Could it get even better? The application of computer science on prediction can have a massive impact on the world by
          predicting future events and using that knowledge to avoid catastrophes.

        <h2 align="center">Current & Future Uses</h2>
        <p align="justify">In today's world, computers are utilised for making ever-so important investment decisions. The computers often go through a complex decision tree (algorithm) to come to a conclusion on whether or not it would be a wise decision. The accuracy of the decision can be improved by adding more branches to the existing decision tree.
        <br><br>From being able to predict human behaviour to calculating the trajectory of dangerous comets close to the earth, analsysis and prediction have made a giant contribution to todays society.
      Right now as we speak, computers are handling large amounts of calculations and decisions in order to predict possible outbreak patterns of pathogens, tsunamis and even the climate.
    <br><br>What else can learn from predictive analystics?  Well computers are now being taught how to predict the future and there has been some luck within the field. It might not be much however there has been a computer that has been able to predict a few seconds into the future. If this gets developed well then there is a plethora of progress that could happen within the society and the industry.</p>

        <h2 align="center">It's Use In Weather Forecasting</h2>
        <p align="justify">Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantative numerical data about the current state of the atmosphere which is captured a variety of different sensors. In the case of weather models, data such as rain fall, temperature and wind speed are fed into the computer for it to analyse. This data is transmitted and collected centrally from thousdands of centers and put into a mathematical model in which predictions can be made from current conditions.
          <br><br>Parallel processing is generally used for complex calculations in mathematical weather models but this make its so that the equipment used is extremely expensive. Even though the more sophisticated and up-to-date the model means that the forecast predicted would be more accurate however it cannot account for freak weather patterns. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29789208" target="_blank">Read this news article if you are interested.</a>

          </article>
          <br><br>From this you can see how weather forecasts are formed. This provides a positive impact on society as not only will it warn people of potential weather hazards but also allow people to plan events ahead of time depending upon the weather.
